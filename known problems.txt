1. If you create a new directory within another new directory and name it the same thing
   as a file in that same directory (including the file extension) and then upload it, it
   might break.

2. Not sure what happens if you try to create a drive folder in your google drive
	i.e.: a folder that doesn't have a parent

3. If you run sync_up, then delete all the contents of the google drive folder, then run it again
   without restarting the application, it doesn't create the folders, it just uploads the files

4. If you run sync_up, then delete one file within a subfolder, then run it again, it uploads that
   file multiple times
